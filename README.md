# NumericalAnalysisProject
Mandatory Numerical Analysis coursework completed in Python.

There are four exercises, so ARAN1 is the solution to the first, ARAN2 the second, etc.
If the name is for example ARAN31 then it's the 1st part of the third exercise.
Everything is described in numan.pdf, however it is in Greek.
